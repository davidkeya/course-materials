    "Is the MSE for a fitted linear regression the same thing as the bias?\n",
    "- It's close, but bias does not apply to a specific fitted model. Bias is the expected error of a model no matter what subset of the data it is fit on. This way, if we happen to get a lucky MSE fitting a model on a particular subset of our data, this does not mean we will have a low bias overall."

You could also use this as a final step after the model is finalized (often called evaluating the model against a **validation set**).\n",
