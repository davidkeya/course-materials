The Titanic survival dataset was chosen for this lesson because it is interesting, easy to understand, and commonly used in other tutorials. This dataset is also used in an official Kaggle tutorial (https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic), which might be useful for students who want to explore Kaggle or the dataset further.

## Learning Objectives
- **Compute** dot products, matrix multiplications, and vector norms by hand and using NumPy.
- **Code** summary statistics using NumPy and Pandas: mean, median, mode, max, min, quartile, inter-quartile range, variance, standard deviation, and correlation.
- **Create** basic data visualizations - including: scatter plots, box plots, and histograms.
- **Describe** characteristics and trends in a dataset using visualizations.
- **Describe** the bias and variance of statistical estimators.
- **Identify** a normal distribution within a dataset using summary statistics and data visualizations.
