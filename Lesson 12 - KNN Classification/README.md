| Lesson | K-Nearest Neighbors with Scikit-Learn | [Here](./knn_with_sklearn.ipynb) |
| Solution  | Solution code for blanked out lesson samples | [Here](./solution-code/knn_with_sklearn-solution.ipynb) |
| Datasets | 2015 Season Statistics for ~500 NBA Players | [Here](./data/NBA_players_2015.csv) |
| Datasets | The Iris Dataset (Flowers) | [Here](./data/iris.data) |
| Practice | Two activities to practice KNN | [Here](./practice/) |
| Slides | Slide deck of material covered in lesson | [Here](./slides/) |


This lesson uses the Iris dataset and the NBA player statistics dataset. The Iris allows students to easily make their own rules-based model and is easy to visualize for KNN. The NBA dataset results in a very nice curve for choosing K.

## Learning Objectives
- Utilize the KNN model on the iris data set.
- Implement scikit-learn's KNN model.
- Assess the fit of a KNN Model using scikit-learn.
