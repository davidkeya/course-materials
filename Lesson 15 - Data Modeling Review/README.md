## Flex Session

Please note that this is a flex session. Instructors may use this session however they see fit. Below, we provide some recommendations for productively structuring class time. We suggest the following options:

 - Reviewing materials covered in this unit
 - Assigning student-led course enrichment content 
 - Providing students with in-class project workshop time
 - Delivering a lesson on an additional subject of the instructor's choice

## Lesson Outline

**Unit Content Review** (30-45 minutes)
- Create a list of all questions relating to Unit content
- Assign students into groups and ask each group to look up answers to 1-3 questions
- Facilitate answer presentations to the class

**Optional: Unit Project Workshop** (1 hour)
 - [Assign students to work on the unit project activity in-class](https://git.generalassemb.ly/data-part-time/unit-3_project)

**Final Project Workshop** (1.5-2 hours)

> Alternatively, instructors are free to use this class time to present lesson materials on an additional topic of their choice.

## Instructor Tips
 - Create an ongoing list of major questions (e.g. a "parking lot") throughout the unit, then use this time to address them.
 - After students finish their presentations, follow up with clarifications to ensure all questions are fully resolved.
 - If there are insufficient questions to address, here are some alternative student-led activity ideas or homework suggestions:
   - Ask students to create shared review or recap materials for the class. Here are some possibilities: 
     - Slide decks of 5-10 slides each
     - One page summaries of a given concept or topic
     - Topic-based contributions to a course wiki

   - Require students to write or blog about topics from the unit. Here are some suggested prompts:
     - Describing potential use cases for a given topic
     - Create an online tutorial explaining how to perform a specific task or skill
     - Start and curate a comment thread on an online forum
