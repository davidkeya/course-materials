An advantage of a DataFrame over a 2-dimensional NumPy array is that the DataFrame can have columns of various types within a single table. That said, each column should have a specific dtype; you don't want to be mixing bools with ints with strings within a single column. For one thing, this is slow. It forces the column to be have an `object` dtype (the fallback container type), which means you don't get any of the type-specific optimizations in pandas. For another, it violates the maxims of tidy data.\n",
