## Learning Objectives
- **Recall** how to perform linear regression in scikit-learn.
- **Demonstrate** why logistic regression is a better alternative for classification than linear regression.
- **Understand** the concepts of probability, odds, e, log, and log-odds in relation to machine learning.
- **Explain** how logistic regression works.
- **Interpret** logistic regression coefficients.
- **Use** logistic regression with categorical features.
- **Compare** logistic regression with other models.
- **Utilize** different metrics for evaluating classifier models.
- **Construct** a confusion matrix based on predicted classes.

## Student Requirements

Before this lesson(s), students should already be able to:

- Load in and perform basic analysis and manipulation on data in Pandas 
- Build and interpret a linear regression model
- Explain the basics of probability
- Distinguish between continuous and categorical variables
- Understand the bias-variance tradeoff and use confusion matrices to tune this balance
