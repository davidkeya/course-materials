### What is a good question?

#### Demo: Diagramming An AIM

Determine the association of foods in the home with child dietary intake. Using one 24-hour recall from the cross-sectional NHANES 2007-2010 we will determine the factors associated with food available in the homes of American children and adolescents. We will test if reported availability of fruits, dark green vegetables, low fat milk or sugar sweetened beverages available in the home increases the likelihood that children and adolescents will meet their USDA recommended dietary intake for that food.

#### Hypothesis

Children will be more likely to meet the USDA recommended intake level when food is always available in their home compared to rarely or never.

**How data was collected:**

24-hour recall, self-reported

**What data was collected:**

Fruits, dark green vegetables, low fat milk or sugar sweetened beverages, always vs. rarely available

**How data will be analyzed:**

Using USDA recommendations as a gold-standard to measure the association

**The specific hypothesis & direction of the expected associations:**

Children will be more likely to meet their recommended intake level


#### Measureable
Determine the association of foods in the home with child dietary intake.

We will test if the reported availability of certain foods increases the likelihood that children and adolescents will meet their USDA recommended dietary intake for food.

#### Attainable
Cross-sectional data has inherent limitations; one of the most common is that causal inference is typically not possible.

Note that we are determining association, not causation.

#### Reproducible
With all the specifics, it would be straightforward to pull the data from NHANES and reproduce the analysis.

#### Time Bound

Using one 24-hour recall from NHANES 2007-2010, we will determine the factors associated with food available in the homes of American children and adolescents.





This example laid out research goals.

In a business setting, you will need to articulate business objectives.

Example:  Success for the Netflix recommendation engine may be if 70% of customers over the age of 18 select a movie from the recommended queue during Q3 of 2015.

Regardless of setting, planning ahead and outlining the entire project will help you save time. You'll prioritize tasks better, you won't get stuck on small details that don't matter, and most importantly, you'll know when to stop.
