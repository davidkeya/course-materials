So how do we distinguish data science from traditional analytics? A helpful comparison is that analytics is useful for extracting explicit insights from data — i.e., summary statistics, trends, correlations — while data science is a means of extracting implicit insights such as multivariable correlations, natural language processing, and machine learning models.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The additional insights we can gain with data science have increased the functionality of data and the value of the analytical process. Consequently, part of data science is developing new methods for extracting insights from existing data sets to increase their value.  \n",

    "\n",
    "When it comes to the debate of Python versus R, there is no clear winner; both have their pros and cons. While R was the original language for data science and processing, Python's popularity has serged in recent years, to the point where its used equally throughout the field. In addition to the friendly nature of the language, Python's origin as an open-source programming language have greatly contributed to its appeal. Because it is a programming language, those that pick it up for data science can easily pick up front-end and back-end programming skills with Python. Additionally, this allows data science deliverables built in Python to be immediately implemented within a Python-based website or program.  \n",
