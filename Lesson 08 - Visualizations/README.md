**Instructor:**
- Start with the lesson Jupyter slide deck.
- Then, walk the students through each part of the lab. Discuss when to use each type of plot.
- Periodically stop and let the students try the challenges (together in groups if needed). The challenges are typically just 1-3 lines of code that are very similar to what was just discussed.

This lesson purposefully uses a large number of datasets. This allows students to practice opening different types of data files. Having many datasets available allows us to explore a variety of visualizations throughout the lesson that might not be present in one dataset alone.
