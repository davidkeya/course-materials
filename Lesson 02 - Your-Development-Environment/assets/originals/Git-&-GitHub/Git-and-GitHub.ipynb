    "SSH, or Secure Shell, is a common means of adding an additional layer of security.  Simply put, the SSH key is used to establish authenticity between a client and a server so that a secure connection or \"tunnel\" can be formed.  This can be useful for secure file sharing or remote application access.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### How SSH works\n",
    "\n",
    "The SSH process at a high level is relatively simple.  \n",
    "1. Client makes a request to the server.\n",
    "2. Server responds asking for authentication.\n",
    "3. Client provides authentication.\n",
    "4. If authentication is correct, a connection is established.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: You will need to complete which ever process you choose twice. Once for your GitHub account and once for your GitHub Enterprise account.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** Setting up the SSH Agent is critical if you don't want to be prompted for a password everytime you push or pull via SSH."
