## Materials We Provide

| Topic | Description | Link |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Starter Code | Project Description | [Here](./linreg-knn-project.ipynb) |
| Solution Code | Sample solutions for project questions | [Here](./Solution-Code/linreg-knn-project-solution.ipynb) |
| Dataset | Boston Housing Dataset (Provided as back-up to embedded data)| [Here](./data/boston_data.csv) |

> Note: Instructors should withold providing project solutions until students have submitted their drafts. In order to do so, avoid forking this repo and instead clone down materials locally, create a new repository in your student org, and upload materials manually.

## Project Objective

In this project, you'll build a linear regression model and a KNN model via guided prompts. You will be exposed to model validation using the train/test split and K-Fold methods in order to fit three different models on sample Boston housing data.

You will be:
  - Creating a train/test split of the data.
  - Training each of your models on the training data.
  - Evaluating each of the models on the test data.
  - Ranking the models by how well they score on the testing data set.

## Project Requirements

In a Jupyter Notebook, create working solutions for all of the questions.

Your notebook should include:

1. Text for each question, copy and pasted from this file (preferably in markdown).
2. A working solution to each problem.
   - Do not include test, practice, or broken code (*unless you were unable to create a working solution*).
3. Comments for all of your code.
   - In your comments, describe any assumptions you made in order to solve these problems.

4. **Bonus**: In programming (and life), there may be multiple ways to solve a problem. After completing our challenges, go back and see if you can think of any other valid methods!

## Rubric

For all projects, requirements will be evaluated on a simple point scale of 0, 1, or 2.

Score | Expectations
:--- | :---
**0** | _Incomplete._
**1** | _Does not meet expectations._
**2** | _Meets expectations, good job!_

Additionally, instructors will provide feedback on required portions of your project.

## Submission

Your instructor will explain how to submit your assignment. Typically, this is done either by:

- Creating a repository in your github profile, hosting your materials, and sharing a link with your instructor. [or]
- Forking the project repository, adding your solutions, and submitting a pull request back to the relevant repo.
